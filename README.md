## Getting started

Install in your system T1k's gem

```ruby
$ gem install t1k
```

Start using t1k into your project directory

```shell
$ t1k init
```

It creates the T1000 configuration file inside your project folder.

### T1000 Configuration File
Here is a possible configuration for `github` and `trello`.
Your `T1000` should look like this:

```ruby
T1k.setup do |config|
  # Setup Github repository credentials
  # Create an auth_token here: https://github.com/settings/applications
  #
  # config.repository.adapter = :github
  # config.repository.setup do |c|
  #   c.user = "GITHUB_USER"
  #   c.repo = "REPOSITORY_NAME"
  #   c.oauth_token = "YOUR_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN"
  # end

  # If you'll use bitbucket as repository you should set a shell variable with
  # your password as BITBUCKET_PWD in order to access bitbucket api
  #  config.repository.adapter = :bitbucket
  #  config.repository.setup do |c|
  #    c.user        = "YOUR_BITBUCKET_USERNAME"
  #    c.repo        = "REPOSITORY_NAME"
  #    c.password    = "#{ENV['BITBUCKET_PWD']}"
  #  end

  # Setup Trello board credentials
  #
  # Trello APP_DEVELOPER_KEY: https://trello.com/app-key
  # Trello App permission key: https://trello.com/1/connect?key=YOUR_KEY&name=BOARD_NAME&expiration=never&response_type=token&scope=read,write
  #
  # config.tracker.adapter = [:trello, :pivotal, :none]
  # config.tracker.setup do |c|
  #   c.user_name = "TRELLO_USER"
  #   c.board_name = "TRELLO_BOARD_NAME"
  #   c.member_token = "TRELLO_APP_TOKEN"
  #   c.developer_public_key = "TRELLO_DEVELOPER_PUB_KEY"
  # end
end
```

* When using `:github` as your repository, you must define `:oauth_token`, `:user`, `:repo`.
* When using `:trello` as your tracker, you must define `:developer_public_key`, `:member_token`, `:user_name` and `:board_name`. Get your `:developer_public_key` [here](https://trello.com/app-key) and the `:member_token` you must replace your developer key in the url `https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=YOURAPIKEY&response_type=token&expiration=never&scope=read,write`.
* When using `:none` as your tracker, T1k will create issues with the name passed as argument on `t1k hack <issue-name>`

## Commands

Basic workflow with Trello as Tracker:

```shell
$ t1k hack yk2adi9
$ t1k commit -m 'commit message'
$ t1k commit -m 'finish issue and close it' -c
$ t1k sink
$ t1k ship
```

### Help

`t1k --help`

```
Usage: t1k [command] [options]

  Commands:
    commit,cmt                                          # Commit current staged changes
    hack,hck <card_url>                                 # Checkout to a new branch or existing branch associated with tracked card (issue)
    init,setup                                          # Create T1000 credentials file template in your current folder
    ship,pack,deliver                                   # Delivery your changes to local and remote master branch
    sink,sync                                           # Update current branch with master (ie Sync with master)
    validate                                            # Validate current credentials
    help [<command>]                                    # Display help

  Options:
    -v, --version                                       # Display the current version
    -h, --help                                          # Display this help message
```

### Validate

Validates your current credentials stored in `T1000` file

### Init

Just adds to your project folder a `T1000` config file template

### Hack

When you type `$ t1k hack 18asd92` t1k creates or switches to a branch associated to a card.

* Where `18asd92` can be the card identifier or any url part of its.

### Commit

Commit has to params options, -m and -c.

```
Usage: t1k commit,cmt [options]

  Options:
    -c, --[no-]close                                    # Close current branch and resolves issue
    -m, --message <message>                             # Add a message to the commit
    -h, --help                                          # Display this help message
```

2. `t1k commit -m 'message'` : commits your staged changes with a custom message
2. `t1k commit -c -m 'message'` : `-c` is used to close your issue.

### Sink

Just _sync_ with master your current branch

### Ship

It deliveries to master (local and remote) your branch and changes current branch to master
